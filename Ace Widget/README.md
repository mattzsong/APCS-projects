Ace Widget Company has asked you to write a program which will keep track of the sales for each of their sales employees(Max of 10). The program will enter the name of the employee, and their quarterly sales. The program will:
1. Output a the sales for all employees. The output will show the employeeâ€™s name quarter 1, quarter 2, quarter 3, quarter 4 and total sales(calculated from the four quarters) for each employee. The output must be formatted so that each line contains one employee's data in a neatly formatted manner, money items contain a $ sign and 2 numbers after the decimal. 
2. Output all of the data of a specified employee with all of information clearly labeled. 
3. Output the name of the employee(s) with the highest sales and highest sales amount. 
4. Output the name of the employee(s) with the lowest sales and lowest sales amount. 
This program should use the terminal and be able to perform any of the above functions in any order, after the first two employees are entered.
