Write a program which will input 2 fractions (numerator and denominator) and output the product of the two fractions in reduced form. This program should prompt the user to input the numerator and denominator of both fractions as integers and the answer will be displayed on a new line. Make certain you check input data so that a zero is not inputted into the denominator of either fraction.
