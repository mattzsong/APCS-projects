## Program 10: Mean, Median, Mode using Insertion Sort
Write a program which will allow the user to input a set of integers (no more than 25) and the program will output the mean (average), median (middle data item) and mode (most frequently occurring data item or items).  

The input should be entered in no particular order and will use the insertion sort at least once.  The user should be able to add (input) numbers, output mean, median or mode, input more numbers and output mean median or mode etc.  

There should be a reset option to empty the array of integers and a print all button to print all numbers in the array in order from smaller to larger.  

If there is only one of each number, please indicate there is no mode.  If more than one number most frequently appears then make certain to list both (or all) as the mode.  

Extra Credit: Find and display the standard deviation of the data.  Also, allow the input as a string that you parse into the array (example: “0, -5, 13, 3” is the input, then parse it into the individual numbers)
