Write a well-formatted program with top down design, which will input a set of numbers (no more than 25), and will output the the longest sequence of nondecreasing numbers. For instance if the input is 17, 31, 40, 5, 6, 10, 46, 37, 53, 12, 9, 86 the output is 5, 6, 10, 46. If two or more tie for longest print all of them. For instance 17, 31, 40, 5, 6, 10, 3, 37, 53, 12, 9, 86  the output is 17, 31, 40 and 5, 6, 10, and 3, 37, 53. 
The program should use the terminal to ask the user to input a number, output the entire sequence, output the longest non-decreasing sequence, reset or end the program. 
Please make certain that a user can interchange any of these operations. In other words, the user should be able to input a set of numbers, print the longest non-decreasing sequences, add more numbers to the existing set, print the longest non-decreasing sequences, reset the list to delete all numbers, input a set of numbers, print the longest non-decreasing sequences etc. 
Inputting numbers should be “user friendly” by asking the user what they would like to do after each action is performed.
