## Two Dimensional Arrays: Magic Square

A magic square is a square array of positive integers such that the sum of all rows, columns, and diagonals are the same value.
Write a program which:
1. Allows user to input the size (minimum 2x2, maximum 8x8)
2. Allows user to input numbers into the magic square (error check that all numbers are positive integers)
3. Outputs if the square is a magic square
4. If magic square, the magic square constant is printed
5. Has easy number input. (automatically asks for the next input till array is filled to appropriate size)

Extra Credit:
Research how to create a magic square (not all the same number), if given an odd size (3x3, 5x5, etc. ) and one given number. The extra credit program will create a magic square of consecutive numbers starting at the given number.
