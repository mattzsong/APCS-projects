Write a program that will input a string and if it starts with an equal sign and the string is a valid arithmetic expression, output the value of the expression. If, though, there is an error in the expression, have the program indicate input error. If the expression does not start with an equal sign, throw an error and echo print the expression. Your program should be able to handle any decimal number and one arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /). Your program must handle Exception Gracefully, ie. use Try-Catch Statements for Error Handling. For Extra Credit, write a program which can deal with more than one operation using order of operations. 
Example Output:

=-56+2.5
Output
-53.5

=56e+8
Output
Error

78+23
Output
78+23
