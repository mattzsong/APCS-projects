## People Search
Write a program which will:
1.)  Create a class called person containing:
        Name
		Age
Allow the user to input an array (not an ArrayList) of type person. When adding a new object, the object will be put at the end of the array (the user can add to the array at any point in this program).
Allow the user to search the array by name using a sequential or binary search (both types of searches must be available). If the person is not found, a message should appear indicating the person is not in the array.  If the person is found, have a dialogue option appear that shows all the information about the person. Allow the user to edit any information about the person or even delete the person.    
Allow the user to print the names of all people in alphabetical order 
Use the selection sort when using a binary search.
Count and print the number of comparisons made to find or not find a person when using either search.
Note:  When deleting a people object, your program should maintain the size of the array by the count of people (it will need to resize the array).  It should not set the deleted object position to null or some other flag. This program will be graded out of a 100.
