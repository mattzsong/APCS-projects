## Program 11: Selection Sort (Student Grades)

Write a program which will create a class called StudentInfo that contains a student’s name, year of graduation, and final average.

Only allow the user to enter a maximum of 15 students.

Also create a class called AllStudents which will contain an array of StudentInfo and will print AllStudents in order by name or by final average (two different types of outputs).  When printing AllStudents in order by name, the sort (use selection sort) should be in ascending (a-z) order, and when printing AllStudents in order by final average, the final average should be in descending order (100-0).  Final average should be rounded to the nearest unit.
 
Extra Credit: Create a new class called Statistics containing methods and arrays of the entire class’s (class of students) quarter averages, which are used to find the final average.  The user can then have the option to print out the mean, median, mode and standard deviation for the entire class’s quarter averages.
