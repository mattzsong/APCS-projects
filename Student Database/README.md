## Student Database
You are going to write a program which will contain the following objects using inheritance.  The objects are Person, Student, Undergraduate and GraduateStudent.  Person will contain the instance variable name, Student will inherit from Person and will contain student ID number, Undergraduate will inherit from Student and will contain grade level (freshmen, sophomore, junior or senior) and GraduateStudent will inherit from Student and contain its major.  Each class will contain a print method (called print) which will print out all information about the object (including the information it inherits).  In undergraduate and graduate, the classes will also include a method called equals which will determine if an undergraduate is the same grade level as another (passed in as a parameter) comparing its level and if a GraduateStudent has the same major.  Allow the user to input an array of Person (max 10) and perform the following operations.
 Print all Persons
 Print all Students
 Print all Undergraduates
 Print all GraduateStudents
Input a Grade Level or Major and print those Persons already in the array that have the same grade or major.
